# Zombie_jump
IN PROGRESS

Attempting to create a simple jumping game.

I have zombie Sprites coming from the right side of the screen and the player sprite has to jump to avoid them or jump on top of them to delete them.
Im working on this as I start to learn and better understand game design and mechanics.

NEED TO:
add a score for when the player jumps on the zombie.
add a good reset button.
space out the zombies better
improve sprite movements
add a number of waves and end game.
